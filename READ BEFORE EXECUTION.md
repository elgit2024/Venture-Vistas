### IMPORTANT
Vendor Login Procedure:

To become a vendor, an individual must send a vendor request to the admin. Once the admin receives and reviews the request in the vendor request section of the admin panel, they will designate the requester as STAFF through the user section. The admin can select the user who sent the vendor request and assign them as staff. This designation grants the user access to the vendor dashboard.

In summary, when the admin assigns the user as STAFF, the user becomes a vendor. After this process, the newly appointed vendor can log into the vendor dashboard via the vendor button in the vendor option.
